Will the lengths a, b, and c make a triangle?

Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if 
a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Triangle Inequality Theorem
  A + B > C
  B + C > A
  A + C > B
All 3 of these conditions must return true
